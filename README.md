# Income Prediction: U.S. Census Data Modeling

###### This is a **Machine Learning project** focused on predicting individuals' income using the 1994 U.S. Census dataset. The project employs various supervised learning algorithms to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000, based on personal and demographic features.

## Overview

The **Income Prediction** project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 based on publicly available census data. The dataset includes various features such as age, education, occupation, and marital status. By utilizing a series of supervised learning algorithms, the goal is to determine which model performs best at predicting income class and then optimize that model for better accuracy.

This README will guide you through the project features, installation instructions, and provide an overview of the methodologies and models used.

## Overview

The **Income Prediction** project uses data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census to build a classification model. The goal is to predict whether an individual earns more than $50,000 based on various demographic and employment features. By employing multiple supervised machine learning models, the project aims to find the best algorithm and optimize it for accuracy.

This project is relevant for non-profit organizations that wish to understand the income distribution of potential donors or individuals they may wish to reach out to. The ability to predict income levels could inform strategies for donation requests or outreach.
